# useMemo & useCallback

## useMemo:

Write a React component that displays a list of `prime numbers` up to a specified limit. Utilize `useMemo` to memoize the list of prime numbers and only recalculate it when the limit changes.

## useCallback:

Create a React component called `ClickCounter` that displays a count, initially set to 0. Add a button and when the button is clicked, the count should increase by 1. Use the `useCallback` hook to create the increment function.

## Both:

Develop a React component that allows users to input a number `'n'` and displays both the `'n'-th` `Fibonacci series`. Implement `useMemo` & `useCallback` to calculate the Fibonacci numbers. Ensure that these calculations only occur when the input `'n'` changes, and memoize the results and functions for performance optimization.
